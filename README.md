## Passwords

Some passwords need to be shared with others, and I can't always expect those others to use LastPass.
So we're going to use:
`{number}{adjective}{animals}{verb}{noun}{symbol}`
This ought to make it memorable, and reasonably random.

*Note*: You aren't expected to like the very first password you get. Run it a few times and pick the parts you like.

**Warning**: This is a joke script, and really shouldn't be
used to create a password for anything more important
than your Netflix subscription.
