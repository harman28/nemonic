## Nemonic

Some passwords need to be shared with others, and I can't always expect those others to use [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/).

So we're going to use:

`{number}{adjective}{animals}{verb}{noun}{symbol}`

This ought to make it memorable, and reasonably random.

Yes, of course this is all inspired from [an XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/936/).

### Notes
* You aren't expected to like the very first password you get. Run it a few times and pick the parts you like.
* I'm not fond of the `symbol` at the end either, but some passwords require a special character. Pick only the bits you need?

### Warning
This is a joke script, and really shouldn't be used to create a password for anything more important than your Netflix subscription.
